# MyShop

**MyShop** is a simple Java console application that models basic shopping functionality — handling orders, products, peripherals and sales.

> This is an older Java project uploaded for reference. Parts of the code were not originally written by me.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a basic shopping system in Java, including:
- Product and peripheral representation  
- Order creation and processing  
- Sale logic  
- Common features extracted into helper classes

The application is structured as a set of Java classes that demonstrate object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation and basic class interaction.
